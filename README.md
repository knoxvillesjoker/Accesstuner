This is an Initial Code piece that is finished for an Alien Isolation Access Tuner replica prop recreation from the game.
The build is documented here: http://forum.alienslegacy.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=19914
Due to limited space of the Arduino Micro I had to only build one of the mini games, but it is game accurate.
